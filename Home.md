Welcome to the beetles-cnn wiki!
This is a tool for predicting the location of beetle chirps in .wav files with neural networks. See wiki links on the right hand side for more information about what this tool can do. You'll probably want to know how to [install](https://github.com/TravisWheelerLab/beetles-cnn/wiki/Installation) and then [predict new .wav files](https://github.com/TravisWheelerLab/beetles-cnn/wiki/Inference-using-pretrained- models) before anything else.

Also covered in this wiki is how to label your own .wav file, extract those labels from the file, and then train new models with your labels!
See the sidebar to the right for more links.

Jupyter notebook with example of evaluating data (upload into colab for GPU access) is [here](https://github.com/TravisWheelerLab/beetles-cnn/blob/main/beetles/resources/using_beetles_on_colab.ipynb).
